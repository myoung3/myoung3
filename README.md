### 

- I'm working on novel applications of machine learning and deep learning methods to spatial and spatiotemporal air pollution prediction using satellite imagery.
- I work with large, irregular spatiotemporal datasets measured and stored as interval data. I developed the R package [intervalaverage](https://github.com/kaufman-lab/intervalaverage) (now available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/intervalaverage/index.html)) for aligning and averaging (aka resampling) large amounts of interval data efficiently in R using both `data.table` and `Rcpp`. The `intervalaverage` package is regularly used in production code on 100+ million row tables.
